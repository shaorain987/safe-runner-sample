# SafeRunner Philosophy (2025)

## Core Beliefs
- **Sovereignty ≠ on-prem**, but *user-controlled execution*
- **Trust comes from transparency and verifiability**, not data locality
- **High-value tasks deserve secure, temporary remote execution**

## Our Only Direction
Deliver automation for high-stakes professional tasks via **user-hosted disposable agents**, with full audit logs, zero data retention, and pay-per-result pricing.

> "We don’t sell compute. We sell the ability to complete high-risk tasks with peace of mind."
